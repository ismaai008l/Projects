# Personal Book Tracker CLI

A simple command-line interface (CLI) tool for tracking books. This project allows users to add books, list all books, and update the reading status of books using a terminal-based interface. The app leverages Pydantic for data validation.

## Features

* Add a new book with details such as title, author, genre, and reading status.
* List all added books with their current status.
* Update the status of a book (e.g., from "to-read" to "reading" or "finished").
* Stores books in a local JSON file for persistence.

## To-Be-Added

* Automatically create a Markdown file for each book to allow user to jot down notes, reflections, or summaries as they read.
